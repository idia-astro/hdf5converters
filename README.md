# hdf5converters
Python scripts to convert FITS and CASA images to HDF5 images using the LOFAR structure


## `fitsToHDF5_LOFAR.py`
`fitsToHDF5_LOFAR.py` converts a single 3D FITS file to the LOFAR-USG-ICD-004 data structure. Currently, the correct metadata is not written to file, but the file structure is created correctly, and an optional  `StokesCoordinates` attribute is written to the `PolarizationCoordinate` sub-group to identify which (if any) Stokes coordinate the dataset refers to.

## `fitsToHDF5_LOFAR_4D.py`
`fitsToHDF5_LOFAR_4D.py` converts a list of 3D FITS files to a modified LOFAR-USG-ICD-004 data structure. Currently, the correct metadata is not written to file, but a `MultiStokes` flag and a list of the included Stokes coordinates in the form of the `StokesCoordinates` attribute are written to the `PolarizationCoordinate` sub-group to identify which Stokes coordinates the dataset includes.
